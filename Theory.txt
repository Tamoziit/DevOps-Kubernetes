**KUBERNETES** 
-- Container orchestration system.

#Kubernetes deals with ->
- Automatic deployments of the containerized application across different servers.
- Distribution of the load across multiple servers.
- Auto-scaling of the deployed applications.
- Monitoring & health check of the containers.
- Replacements of the failed containers.

#Runtimes supported by Kubernetes ->
- Docker
- CRI-O
- containerd

**Terminologies & Architecture
--> *Pod* - It is the smallest unit of a Kubernetes cluster (analogous: Docker container). 
--> A Pod may contain --> multiple containers, Shared volumes, shared IP Address.
--> *Kubernetes Cluster* --> Contains different nodes (servers) [which in-turn house different pods].

V
Kubernetes cluster contains 2 types of nodes :
1. Master Node : Orchestrates the worker nodes, by distributing the load among the worker loads.
2. Worker Node : Carries out the operation/load assigned to it by master node.

--> Master node contains --> API server, Scheduler, Kube Controller Manager, Cloud Controller Manager, etcd, DNS Services, kubelet, kube-proxy, container runtime.
--> Worker node contains --> kubelet, kube-proxy, container runtime.
--> Master node communicates with the kubelet of the worker nodes through its API server.
--> kube-proxy is responsible for the network connection of each node.
--> Scheduler - Orchestrates & manages the load distribution among different worker nodes.
--> Kube Controller Manager - Controls the functioning of each node of a Kubernetes cluster.
--> Cloud Controller Manager - Deals with the cloud services for our deployment server (including auto-scaling the deployment). It also manages all the proxy/IP address for the web to communicate with our server.
--> etcd - stores all deployment logs as key value pairs.
--> DNS Services - Responsible for names resolution in the entire Kubernetes cluster. It can be used to connect 2 different services by their names.

--> kubectl --> Kube control -> A CLI tool to control kubernetes cluster. --> HTTPS comms. b/w API Server of master node of a kube cluster & kubectl.
